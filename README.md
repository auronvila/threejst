<h3> any feedback would be helpful </h3>

<p> I think that the 3d world and metawerse are coming fast and created a solution about boring setup of threejs scene It can be developed and maybe upgrade it to be able to make movements in scene and different mechanics . After all everyone knows that 3d world and websites will replace the current one :) </p>
